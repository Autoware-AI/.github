## Autoware-AI 👋

This organization was originally created to keep the repositories related to the Autoware-AI project, the world's first "all-in-one" open-source software for self-driving vehicles.
The repositories were transferred to the AutowareFoundation GitHub as of June 2022.

If you wish to use Autoware, please visit the new repository https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.
