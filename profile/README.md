## Autoware-AI

This organization was originally created to keep the repositories related to the Autoware-AI project, the world's first "all-in-one" open-source software for self-driving vehicles.

### Announcement on End-of-Life of Autoware-AI by the end of 2022  and Transition to ROS2
As some users may know, the Autoware Foundation is currently developing Autoware Core/Universe, which is the ROS2 version of Autoware. To focus our resources, the Technical Steering Committee has decided on the end-of-life date for Autoware.AI by the end of 2022. ([announced in 2020](https://discourse.ros.org/t/end-of-life-dates-for-autoware-ai/13750).)

After the end-of-life, no releases will be made and no merge requests will be accepted. The source will still be available if someone wishes to fork and maintain it themselves, but the Autoware Foundation will not commit any resources to maintain Autoware-AI beyond this date.

Please be aware that we do NOT stop the development of Autoware, and we are just transitioning to ROS 2 based Autoware for future development. We encourage any current and future contributors to consider using/contributing to Autoware Core/Universe rather than Autoware-AI.
If you wish to use the newest Autoware, please visit the new repository https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.

### People who wish to use Autoware-AI
The Autoware-AI repositories were transferred to the AutowareFoundation GitHub as of June 2022 to have a single GitHub organization for Autoware.
